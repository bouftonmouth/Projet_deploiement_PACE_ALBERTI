Project Title: Optimization of a Genetic Algorithm

Description: The goal of this python module is to optimize a genome or a population of genomes. For this purpose, at each generation, mutations and crossings over will take place in the genomes in order to vary their cost function. A selection allows to modify only those genomes that are far from the cost threshold.

Getting Started: The module consists of several small independent functions that allow to :
	- Build a population
	- Calculate the cost function of each genome
	- Selecting genomes
	- Performing mutations and crossing over
	- Calculate average and minimal costs 
All functions come together in one main function. It is possible to test each function independently, but if you want to call the module as a whole right away, start the algofinal function.

Prerequisites: Knowledge of python programming and optimization

Libraries to be installed: numpy and matplotlib

Installation: In a terminal enter the following command: "pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ algorithm-bio-inspire".

Made with :
	- The numpy library for python 3
	- The matplotlib library for python 3
